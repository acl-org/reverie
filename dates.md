## Reviewing Schedule

From October 2022 to February 2025, ARR ran 8-week review cycles, with submission deadlines [on the 15th of every second month](/key-changes-in-the-october-cycle/). After extensive deliberation and [soliciting community feedback](https://www.aclweb.org/portal/content/acl-survey-what-should-acl-peer-review-process-be-future), the  [ACL Peer Review Committee](https://www.aclweb.org/adminwiki/index.php/ACL_Peer_Review_Standing_Committee) recommended to ACL exec to switch to 10-week cycles. The new schedule will be in action, starting after February 2025 cycle. The full committtee report is available in the [adminwiki](https://www.aclweb.org/adminwiki/images/9/9e/COPR-5-cycle-report-to-publish.pdf).

This means that instead of 6 cycles a year there will generally be 5, but with more reasonable timelines for the review tasks and author response, as well as platform maintenance. It will allow the cycles to always start on Mondays, and develop a consistent schedule that clashes with weekends less (a recurrent problem in the past). In 2025, due to the switch to 10-week cycles enacted relatively late in the year, there will be 4 review cycles in total.

The new submission dates in 2025 are as follows:

| Cycle | Submission | Author Response | Cycle End |
| :---: | :-------------: | :-------------: | :-------: |
| Feburary 2025 | Feburary 15 | March 27 - April 1 | April 15 |
| May 2025 | May 19 | TBA | July 27 |
| July 2025 | July 28 | TBA | October 5|
| October 2025 | October 6 | TBA | December 14 |
| January 2026 | January 5 | TBA | March 15 |

## Submission to Participating Venues

Any paper that is not desk rejected will receive reviews. Once authors have reviews they may choose to [revise and resubmit](/authors.md#step4) for another round of reviews, or [commit their paper *and reviews* to a publication venue](/authors.md#step5).

The upcoming publication venues participating in ARR are listed below. If you represent a publication venue and would like to be added to this list, please see [this page](/organizers).
